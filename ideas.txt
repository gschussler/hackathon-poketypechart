    - Sprite of that pokemon appears when selected
    - Two sides to the form, so that two pokemon can be compared, or two types can be compared

Attack:
- Pokemon type doesn't matter here, just the moves available to said pokemon
- Use types of move against enemy pokemon type

Defense:
- Pokemon type is the only factor here, since we are only dealing in effectiveness
