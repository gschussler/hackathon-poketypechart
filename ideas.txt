Dynamic Pokemon Type Chart

API(s) utilized:
- Pokeapi https://github.com/favware/graphql-pokemon#about

MVP:
- Layout:
  - Type Chart, interactive.
  - Submission form where you could type Pokemon name or type
    - Sprite of that pokemon appears when selected
    - Two sides to the form, so that two pokemon can be compared, or two types can be compared

Attack:
- Pokemon type doesn't matter here, just the moves available to said pokemon
- Use types of move against enemy pokemon type

Defense:
- Pokemon type is the only factor here, since we are only dealing in effectiveness

Stretch:
- Add stats as well, not just effectiveness


Needed functionality

TypeChart logic

Submission Form
- prompt()


I PUT MANY COMMENTS IN MAIN.JS

I apologize if it is a bit convoluted, but I realized too late that
we couldn't make api calls to pokeAPI because the url that is sending
the fetch request is leetcode lol.

- Got the table cells to render decently

- Attack and defense type cells are clickable with caveats
  - Anything but normal breaks in the attack column (column 0) if clicked on
  - There isn't a limit to the amount of defense types that can be clicked in row 0

- Tried to implement a dropdown to switch generations, was before I realized I couldn't fetch from pokeAPI
